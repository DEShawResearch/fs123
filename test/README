Testing is tricky.

- We need a precheckin script that we can use for gating checkins.
  See ../precheckin

- We need a script that we can run in a devel tree that doesn't
  necessarily "clean" everything in sight before running the way
  ../precheckin does.  See ./runtests.

  runtests starts an fs123p7exportd server and a mount.fs123p7 client.

- We need the actual tests.  See ./t-*

The t-* tests can and should assume that some environment variables
have been set (all of which are stored in c/runenv):

EXPORT_ROOT
MTPT
SERVPORT
