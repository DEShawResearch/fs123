# WARNING!  fs123 does NOT pass its own regressions on MacOS with MacPorts and OSXfuse.

# It does compile and provide some basic functionality.  These notes are a starting point,
# but don't deliver a fully functional fs123.

# This may not be a complete set of prereqs

# To compile on MacOS, with Xcode 10.2 something like this works:

PATH=/opt/local/libexec/gnubin:/opt/local/bin:/usr/bin; FUSELIB=osxfuse CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include -I/opt/local/include/osxfuse" LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib make -f ../GNUmakefile -j check

/opt/local/libexec/gnubin is necessary to run the tests because /usr/bin/mktemp doesn't recognize -p.

But note that make check fails a few of the regression tests:

- t-15cornercases and t-02disconnectd fail because fs123p7 ctl fails.

- t-09w2r and t-07modified fails because fs123 is apparently *not*
satisfying its consistency guarantees.  The kernel-side caching with
OSXfuse might be *very* different from Linux, which could easily break
things.  This may be difficult to fix.

Also note that the tests don't shut down cleanly because osxfuse doesn't have fusermount!
