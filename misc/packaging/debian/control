Package: fs123
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description:  scalable, high-performance, network filesystem.
 A simple web protocol with just 6 request types
 leverages the entire HTTP ecosystem (load balancers,
 proxies, redirects, etc.) and makes it easy to implement and
 debug custom file servers.
 .
 fs123 provides consistency guarantees
 with path-specific, configurable timeouts, which enables
 aggressive in-kernel, local-disk, and shared http-proxy
 caching of positive and negative accesses. It accelerates PATH
 or PYTHONPATH searches, and is WAN/cloud-friendly.
 .
 The client and server are written in C++. Each is a single
 user-space binary that does not require root privileges.
 The client uses the FUSE low-level API, and can work through
 network outages (or even offline) once the on-disk cache is
 primed.  The libevent-based server easily delivers data
 at 40Gbps.
