This directory contains specifications, control-files, scripts, etc.,
related to packaging fs123 for different distros and build systems.
In the long run, files like these are best maintained in separate
repos specific to the individual distros.  We're collecting them here
to make it a little easier for us to build binaries that we can
release ourselves.

What's here:

build-deb, debian/ - work together to build .deb and .dsc packages
build-rpm, fs123p7.spec - work together to build CentOS7 [s]rpms.
