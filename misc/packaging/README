This directory contains specifications, control-files, scripts, etc.,
related to packaging fs123 for different distros and build systems.
It may turn out that having these files in same repo (or the same
branch) as the "upstream" source files is misguided.  Time will tell.
We can always (re)move them.

We'll get started (Sep 2020) with a rudimentary (but working) debian/
directory.  Hopefully, since it's not at top-level, it won't interfere
with any attempts to actually port fs123 to debian.

An rpm/ directory and possibly a macports/ directory are planned.
