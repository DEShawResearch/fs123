In Fs123, cache control logic is the responsibility of the http origin
server.  The cache control decisions are communicated to the fuse
daemon (and to any intermediate proxy caches) through the standard
http Cache-Control: header, and in particular, via its 'max-age'
and 'stale-while-revalidate' directives.

The design of the protocol (see Fs123Protocol) is flexible with
respect to cache control policy.  Cache-control is exclusively through
manipulation of max-age and stale-while-revalidate, but the origin
server *may* implement very complicated and/or fine-grained control
over them.

It's worth noting that once a large value of max-age has been
"released", it may be cached in both intermediate proxies and in the
kernels of machines running mount.fs123.  It is extremely costly to to
change it.  The only recourse is for clients to restart with a new
URL.  Thus, origin servers should be careful to set long max-age only
for directories whose contents is truly immutable.
